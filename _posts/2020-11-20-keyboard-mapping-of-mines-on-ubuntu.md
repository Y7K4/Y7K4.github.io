Today I noticed a subtle difference in the keyboard mapping of the game _Mines_ on Ubuntu.

```
No one plays Mines.
No one plays Mines on Ubuntu.
No one plays Mines on Ubuntu with keyboard.
No one plays Mines on Ubuntu with keyboard ignoring arrow keys.
```

If you think so, then you are wrong. And I found that in 16.04, the keyboard mapping is the Vim style; in 20.04, it's the WASD style.

|      OS      | Left  | Down  |  Up   | Right |
| :----------: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Ubuntu 16.04 |   H   |   J   |   K   |   L   |
| Ubuntu 20.04 |   H   |   J   |   U   |   K   |

I'm not sure about other versions like 14.04 or 18.04, but I'm glad to know if someone tells me in the comment.
