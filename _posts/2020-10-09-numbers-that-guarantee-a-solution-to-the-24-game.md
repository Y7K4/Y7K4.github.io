With `(2, 8)` or `(3, 9)`, and any other two numbers from 1 to 9, there is always a solution to the [24 Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_Game).

## Memories

I first found this when I was a kid and a beginner in programming 	:sunglasses:. This result surprised me because I thought `(2, 6)`, `(4, 6)` or `(3, 8)` were more likely to guarantee a solution.

After many years, as an old beginner now :disappointed_relieved:, I suddenly recall this conclusion and decide to write it down.

否则恐怕就再也不会回忆起来了……



## Other fun facts

Let's say the pair of numbers that guarantees a solution is "good". If the numbers are chosen from 1 to

* 10 or higher: There is no good pair of numbers. Three numbers can be good though, and many solutions exist.
* 8: Only `(2, 8)` and `(4, 5)` are good.
* 7: Only `(4, 5)` is good.

Btw, `(4, 4, 6, 6)`, `(3, 4, 8, 8)` and `(2, 2, 2, 6)` have no solutions.
