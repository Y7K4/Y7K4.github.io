Planning to build a few demos.



<!--more-->



Recently I've added a new page called [Demo](/demo/demo.html) (see the navigation bar on top), which will be used as a gallery listing all my demos. Currently I have a few simple visualizations embedded in my posts, and of course these can be listed. Besides, I also want to build some larger demos that I can keep updating in the long term. These larger demos will be mostly related to robotics, e.g.,

* wheeled robots,
* manipulators,
* legged robots,
* robotic hands,
* UAVs,

and written with JavaScript libraries, e.g.,

* d3.js (for 2D visualization),
* three.js (for 3D visualization),
* ammo.js (for simulation).

I think this kind of long-term goals can motivate me to systematically learn stuff, especially in JavaScript and hopefully in robotics...



## Plans

~~感觉根本来不及，但是先把话放在这~~

By the end of August, I'll launch the demo of wheeled robots with some basic functionality:

* 2D scenario
* wheeled robots kinematics
* manual control
